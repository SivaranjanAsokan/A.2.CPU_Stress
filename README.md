## Introduction

CPU stress testing is useful for performance benchmarking and system reliability testing under high load. This repository includes multiple methods to increase CPU stress on a Linux system.

## Installation

To use the provided scripts, you need to have a Linux environment with necessary tools installed. Here are the steps to set up the tools:

### Installing stress-ng

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install stress-ng
```

### Installing stress

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install stress
```

## Usage

### Using stress-ng

To run a CPU stress test with `stress-ng`, use the following command:

```bash
stress-ng --cpu 4 --timeout 60s
```

- `--cpu 4`: Stress 4 CPU cores.
- `--timeout 60s`: Run the stress test for 60 seconds.

### Using stress

To run a CPU stress test with `stress`, use the following command:

```bash
stress --cpu 4 --timeout 60s
```

- `--cpu 4`: Stress 4 CPU cores.
- `--timeout 60s`: Run the stress test for 60 seconds.

### Custom Shell Script

You can use a custom shell script to stress the CPU. The `cpu_stress.sh` script in this repository can be used as follows:

1. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x cpu_stress.sh
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./cpu_stress.sh
    ```

### Python Script

A Python script, `cpu_stress.py`, is also provided for CPU stress testing. You can use it as follows:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python3 cpu_stress.py
    ```

## Monitoring CPU Usage

While running any of these stress tests, you can monitor CPU usage using the `top` or `htop` command:

```bash
top
```

or

```bash
htop
```

This will allow you to observe the impact of the stress test on the CPU usage of your AWS instance.
